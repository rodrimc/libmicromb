#Micro Multimedia Backend Library

This is a simple multimedia backend. This library has been designed to provide a higher level API for 
handling multimedia objects. 
The library is built on top of the [GStreamer >= 1.6] (http://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/) framework. 

GStreamer is a powerful and flexible framework, maybe that's why it lacks a simple and clear API to 
handle media components. The main purpose of this project is to provide a simple API (start, stop, pause, set...)
to facilitate one to add multimedia capabilities to applications. Under the roof, the library
makes the appropriate calls to the GStreamer API.

#LibPlay
This project has been incorporated within the [LibPlay] (http://github.com/TeleMidia/LibPlay) library and is no longer maintained.
